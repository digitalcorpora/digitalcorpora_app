# digitalcorpora.org python app
This repo provides the custom-written Python code to for the https://DigitalCorpora.org/ website.

The website runs with WordPress. This repo runs in a sub-domain https://downloads.digitalcorproa.org/ provides the browsing functionality of the S3 bucket.  Our development website is https://dev.digitalcorpora.org/

You can also modify the config file to browse other S3 buckets, should you wish to use this on another website.
